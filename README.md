The aim of this data analysis project is to create an automated model of prediction to property rental values
without human bias using regression machine learning algorithms.

The data files consists of information from about 10.692 houses to rent in different cities in Brazil and
13 different features. According to Rubens Junior, who published this dataset, the data was collected from
a rental website, on 3/20/20.

This project is a part of the final evaluation of students on the Data Science Professional Certificate of
Harvardx - Casptone, where each student must choose a dataset on internet and use tools they learned
during the course, applying machine learning

We tested 10 machine learning models and finally we have chosen the ensemble model, equal to the mean
prediction of Random Forest, Random Forest Rborist and Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks as our final
model. After applying it in an unknown dataset (validation) we have the results: RMSE = 2171, Rsquared
= 0.6266 and MAE = 1286.
